## ðŸŽµ Audio Visualization

Audio-reactive effects are among the most popular RGB lighting applications. We plan to expand our framework to fully support audio processing and visualization.

### Planned Features

- **Audio Processing API**

  - Frequency spectrum analysis
  - Beat detection algorithms
  - Volume/amplitude tracking
  - Audio characteristic extraction (density, width, tone)

- **Real-time Audio Processing**

  - Low-latency audio input handling
  - SignalRGB audio engine integration
  - Multiple audio source options (system, microphone, line-in)

- **Visualization Components**

  - Frequency spectrum visualizers
  - Waveform renderers
  - Beat-triggered effects
  - Audio history buffers for pattern recognition

- **Example Effects**
  - Spectrum analyzer with customizable styling
  - Beat-synced color pulse
  - Frequency-band mapped lighting
  - Audio-reactive particle systems

## ðŸŽ¨ Canvas-Based Effects

While WebGL offers powerful GPU-accelerated effects, the Canvas 2D API provides simpler, more accessible drawing capabilities. Supporting both will make our framework more versatile.

### Planned Features

- **BaseCanvasEffect Class**

  - Canvas initialization and management
  - Event handling and lifecycle hooks
  - Animation loop optimized for 2D

- **Canvas Utilities**

  - Shape drawing abstractions
  - Pattern and gradient generators
  - Path-based drawing helpers
  - Text rendering with advanced typography

- **Canvas-WebGL Interoperability**

  - Shared control system
  - Mixed rendering capabilities
  - Runtime switching between modes

- **Example Effects**
  - Color cycling patterns
  - Text-based LED displays
  - Progress bars and meters
  - Game-inspired 2D animations

## ðŸ”Œ Advanced Integrations

Deeper integration with SignalRGB's engine and third-party systems will expand the framework's capabilities.

### Planned Features

- **Smart Tags (Meters) Support**

  - Linear meter detector abstractions
  - Area meter detector abstractions
  - OCR text matching integration
  - Numeric OCR detection

- **Game Integration SDK**

  - Game state detection system
  - Game event handling
  - HTTP API for external control
  - Websocket support for real-time communication

- **Developer API**

  - Remote debugging capabilities
  - Effect parameter inspection
  - Performance monitoring hooks
  - A/B testing framework

- **Hardware Integration Extensions**
  - Per-device effect customization
  - Hardware capability detection
  - Optimized device-specific rendering
  - Multiple layout support
