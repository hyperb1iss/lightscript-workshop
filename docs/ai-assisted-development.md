## üß† Introduction to AI-Assisted Development

LightScript Workshop embraces the future of creative coding with powerful AI-assisted development workflows. By combining the structured framework of LightScript with modern AI tools like Cursor and Claude, you can rapidly prototype, refine, and optimize stunning RGB lighting effects with unprecedented speed and creativity.

This guide will walk you through the process of leveraging AI to create beautiful, performance-optimized effects for SignalRGB.

## üí´ Why Use AI for Effect Development?

- **Accelerated Creativity** - Transform ideas into working code in minutes instead of hours
- **Shader Expertise On-Demand** - Generate complex GLSL shaders without needing to be a graphics programming expert
- **Rapid Prototyping** - Experiment with multiple approaches and visual styles quickly
- **Code Optimization** - Get suggestions for performance improvements and best practices
- **Pattern Recognition** - AI can suggest creative variations based on existing effects

## üîÆ AI-Assisted Development Workflow

### 1. Conceptualize Your Effect

Begin with a clear concept in mind. Describe what you want to create:

- Visual style (particles, waves, geometric patterns, etc.)
- Color behavior (rainbow cycles, reactive colors, etc.)
- Motion and animation style
- Interactive elements

### 2. Choose Your Rendering Approach

Based on your concept, decide whether to use:

- **Canvas 2D** - For particle systems, dynamic drawing, or complex object interactions
- **WebGL/Three.js** - For shader-based effects, 3D rendering, or high-performance pixel manipulation

### 3. Generate the Effect Structure

Use AI to scaffold the basic structure of your effect:

```
Create a new LightScript WebGL effect called "Cosmic Pulse" that uses
raymarching to create an animated nebula with pulsing colors. Include
decorator-based controls for speed, color intensity, and nebula density.
```

The AI will generate:

- Directory structure in `effects/`
- Base effect class with the `@Effect` decorator
- Decorated control properties
- GLSL shader code (for WebGL effects)

### 4. Refine and Customize

Iterate on the generated code with more specific prompts:

```
Modify the fragment shader to use a more vibrant color palette
with electric blues and purples, and make the nebula pulse with
the beat using the speed control. Also, add a new combo box control
for different nebula patterns.
```

### 5. Convert Shadertoy Shaders

Found an amazing shader on Shadertoy? Ask AI to convert it:

```
Convert this Shadertoy shader to a LightScript WebGL effect:
[paste shader code or provide URL]

Add decorator-based controls for:
- Animation speed
- Color saturation
- Pattern density
```

## üåà Example AI Prompts for Effect Creation

### Canvas-Based Particle Effect

```
Create a LightScript Canvas 2D effect called "Neon Particles" with the following features:
- 100-500 glowing particles with trails
- Particles should move in a circular flow pattern
- Color palette should shift gradually between neon colors
- Include decorator-based controls for particle count, speed, and glow intensity
```

### WebGL Shader Effect

```
Create a LightScript WebGL effect called "Digital Wave" that:
- Uses a fragment shader to generate an animated cyberpunk grid
- Includes a procedural wave that moves across the grid
- Has a glowing highlight at wave peaks
- Uses the @Effect decorator and control decorators for grid density,
  wave speed, and color scheme
```

### Shadertoy Conversion

```
Convert this Shadertoy fractal flame effect to LightScript:
[URL or code]

Optimize it for performance and add these decorator-based controls:
- @NumberControl for fractal iteration depth (1-10)
- @NumberControl for color cycling speed
- @ComboboxControl for transform type (linear, polar, spherical)
```

## ‚ö° Advanced AI Techniques

### Effect Hybridization

```
Combine aspects of the "Puff Stuff Tunnel" and "Glow Particles" effects
to create a new effect where glowing particles flow through a tunnel,
leaving trails that follow the tunnel's contours. Use the decorator-based
control system to create intuitive adjustments.
```

### Performance Optimization

```
Review my current effect and suggest optimizations for better performance
on low-end systems, particularly focusing on shader complexity and draw calls.
```

### Visual Enhancement

```
Enhance the visual impact of my effect by adding:
- Bloom/glow post-processing
- Dynamic color grading
- Smoother transitions between states
```

## üîç Troubleshooting with AI

When you encounter issues, AI can help diagnose and fix them:

```
My particle effect has a memory leak - performance degrades over time.
Here's my implementation: [code]
```

Or:

```
The colors in my WebGL shader aren't matching what I expected.
I want vibrant purples and cyans, but I'm getting muted colors.
Here's my shader code: [code]
```

## üìù Example of AI-Generated Effect

Here's what an AI-generated effect might look like using the decorator-based approach:

```typescript
// effects/cosmic-pulse/main.ts
import {
  Effect,
  WebGLEffect,
  NumberControl,
  ComboboxControl,
  ColorControl,
} from "core/decorators";
import fragmentShader from "./fragment.glsl";

interface CosmicPulseControls {
  speed: number;
  intensity: number;
  density: number;
  colorScheme: string;
  glowAmount: number;
}

@Effect({
  name: "Cosmic Pulse",
  description: "Raymarched nebula with pulsing colors",
  author: "AI Assistant",
})
export class CosmicPulseEffect extends WebGLEffect<CosmicPulseControls> {
  @NumberControl({
    label: "Animation Speed",
    min: 0.1,
    max: 5.0,
    default: 1.0,
    tooltip: "Controls how fast the nebula pulses",
  })
  speed!: number;

  @NumberControl({
    label: "Color Intensity",
    min: 0.0,
    max: 2.0,
    default: 1.0,
    tooltip: "Adjusts the vibrancy of colors",
  })
  intensity!: number;

  @NumberControl({
    label: "Nebula Density",
    min: 1.0,
    max: 10.0,
    default: 5.0,
    tooltip: "Controls how dense the nebula appears",
  })
  density!: number;

  @ComboboxControl({
    label: "Color Scheme",
    values: ["Cosmic", "Electric", "Sunset", "Aurora"],
    default: "Cosmic",
    tooltip: "Changes the color palette of the nebula",
  })
  colorScheme!: string;

  @NumberControl({
    label: "Glow Amount",
    min: 0.0,
    max: 1.0,
    default: 0.5,
    tooltip: "Controls the amount of bloom/glow",
  })
  glowAmount!: number;

  constructor() {
    super({
      fragmentShader,
    });
  }

  protected onInit(): void {
    // Initialize any additional resources
  }

  protected updateUniforms(controls: CosmicPulseControls): void {
    if (!this.material) return;

    this.material.uniforms.iSpeed.value = window.speed || 1.0;
    this.material.uniforms.iIntensity.value = window.intensity || 1.0;
    this.material.uniforms.iDensity.value = window.density || 5.0;
    this.material.uniforms.iGlowAmount.value = window.glowAmount || 0.5;

    // Convert color scheme name to value
    let colorSchemeValue = 0;
    switch (window.colorScheme) {
      case "Electric":
        colorSchemeValue = 1;
        break;
      case "Sunset":
        colorSchemeValue = 2;
        break;
      case "Aurora":
        colorSchemeValue = 3;
        break;
      default:
        colorSchemeValue = 0; // Cosmic
    }

    this.material.uniforms.iColorScheme.value = colorSchemeValue;
  }
}
```
